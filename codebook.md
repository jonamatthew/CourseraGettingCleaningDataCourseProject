leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.
Body = related to body movement.
Gravity = acceleration of gravity
Acc = accelerometer measurement
Gyro = gyroscopic measurements
Jerk = sudden movement acceleration
Mag = magnitude of movement
mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.
The units given are gâ€™s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.
